# Color changer [To print]
#### Description:
This is a Python program I created to change black pixels in an image to blue, without altering other colors like white. I developed this program to read the RGB values in an image and change them, allowing me to print documents even when my printer is out of black ink by converting black text to blue.
I use this program together with a PDF converter I created. First, I convert the PDF to JPG, then I change the black text to blue so I can print the document.
