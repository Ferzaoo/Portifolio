#### Description:
The Finance Network is a financial social network designed to allow users to create and manage their investment portfolios while connecting with other users to share and follow portfolios. The platform, inspired by the design and functionalities of Facebook, is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and aims to facilitate interaction among investors, promoting the sharing of investment strategies and collaboration.

Features:

User Registration and Login: The platform includes a secure user authentication system that allows users to register with a unique username and password. This feature ensures that each user has a personalized experience with their own set of portfolios and investments.

Portfolio Creation: Users can create multiple investment portfolios, each with a distinct name. The portfolios act as containers for various investments, enabling users to organize their investments by different criteria or goals. Each portfolio can be edited or deleted as needed, giving users full control over their investment management.

Adding Investments: Within each portfolio, users can add different investments by specifying the stock symbol and the number of shares they own. This feature allows for detailed tracking of investments across multiple portfolios, enabling users to monitor their investment strategies effectively.

Real-Time Stock Prices: The platform includes functionality to retrieve real-time stock prices, enabling users to see the latest value of each investment within their portfolios. This feature enhances the platform's utility as a financial tool, allowing users to track the current market value of their portfolios and make informed decisions based on updated financial data.

Portfolio Viewing: Users can view their portfolios at any time, with each portfolio displaying a list of investments, including the stock symbol, the quantity of shares held, and the current stock prices. Additionally, users can view the portfolios of their friends, though they cannot edit or add investments to these portfolios. This feature promotes transparency and allows users to learn from the investment strategies of others.

Friendships and Interaction: The platform includes a social networking feature where users can add other users as friends. Once a friendship is established, users can view their friends' portfolios. This feature fosters a collaborative environment where users can share ideas and strategies, enhancing their investment knowledge through social interaction.

Design and Usability:
The user interface is inspired by Facebook, ensuring a familiar and intuitive experience. The design leverages Bootstrap for a responsive and modern look, with clear menus and navigation links that make the platform easy to use. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, allowing even those with minimal technical knowledge to manage their investments effectively.
